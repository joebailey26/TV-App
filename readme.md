# TV App Concept

This is a quick design concept for a TV App like Netflix or Amazon Prime. There's an accompanying mobile app to go with it.

Ignore the code, it's hella messy and hasn't been optimized for speed, or well anything at all.

I designed it with code because I got annoyed with Figma's absolute positioning, and XD's lack of rulers which are needed when using absolute positioning. Since then, I've found Webflow, which seems much better and uses relative positioning, just like the real web.
